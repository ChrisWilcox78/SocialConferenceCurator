# SocialConferenceCurator

## What it is
A program to allow presenters/organisers of conferences to curate a collection of social media related to some topic in and display or feature it in some way.  Will involve (I'm just getting started on this) a server to do the initial collecting of the media posts and to display the curated colection via a webpage and then two clients: one to take care of the moderation of the media and another for use by a presenter (allowing for the display of featured media, etc.).

Note: initial version will just be developed for Twitter.
